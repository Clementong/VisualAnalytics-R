### Buidling heat maps 

- There is a default function in R to create the heat map
- There are 2 packages we will try, complexheatmap and super heat maps
- used for medical science purposes 

```{r}
packages = c('seriation', 'dendextend', 'heatmaply', 'tidyverse')

for(p in packages){library
  if(!require(p, character.only = T)){
    install.packages(p)
  }
  library(p, character.only = T)
}

wh <- read_csv("data/WHData-2018.csv")

```


## Dataset Preparation 

- we will be using the world happiness index
- we need to change the data to for the heat map to meet the requirements 

```{r}
# each row number will now be identified by the country name (hash matrix)
row.names(wh) <- wh$Country
```

### Selecting the relevant columns
- We need to select the columns we want : Happiness score + [GDP per capital : Perception of Corruption]
- We need to extract the data to matrix only with numerical values

```{r}
wh1 <- dplyr::select(wh, c(3, 7:12))
wh_matrix <- data.matrix(wh)

```

```{r}
wh_heatmap <- heatmap(wh_matrix,
                      Rowv=NA, Colv=NA)
```

```{r}
wh_heatmap <- heatmap(wh_matrix)
```

```{r}
wh_heatmap <- heatmap(wh_matrix,
                      scale="column",
                      cexRow = 0.6, 
                      cexCol = 0.8,
                      margins = c(10, 4))
```


```{r}
heatmaply(mtcars)
```

```{r}
heatmaply(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)])
```
Scaling method is for a scale of values

```{r}
# scale the columns
heatmaply(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)],
          scale = "column")#
```

Normalise is for values to be 0 to 1 

```{r}
heatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]))
```

Note that heatmaply also comes with hierchacial clustering 
- option to calculate the cor-relationship matrix 
- corr matrix aka dissimilarity matrix 
- in heatmaply, we can choose the distance method you want to calculate similarity
- the clustering algorithm and so on 


```{r}
heatmaply(percentize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]))
```
# we dont change the default much, we do a normalisation then we apply the rest

```{r}
heatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),
          dist_method = "euclidean",
          hclust_method = "ward.D")
```
we can use statistical methods to perform the calculation, instead of automation, we can specify what distance methods to use. 

```{r}
wh_d <- dist(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]), method = "euclidean")
dend_expend(wh_d)[[3]]
```
# find k to know what to use - the statistical method to find the elbow

```{r}
wh_clust <- hclust(wh_d, method = "average")
num_k <- find_k(wh_clust)
plot(num_k)
```

```{r}
heatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),
          dist_method = "euclidean",
          hclust_method = "average",
          k_row = 3)
```

```{r}
heatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),
          seriate = "OLO")
```

```{r}
heatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),
          seriate = "GW")
```

```{r}
heatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),
          seriate = "mean")
```

```{r}
heatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),
          seriate = "none")
```

```{r}
heatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),
          seriate = "none",
          colors = Blues)
```

# The finishing touch 

- Make sure you have proper spacing and find out ways how to address such cramp-ness

```{r}
heatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),
          Colv=NA,
          seriate = "none",
          colors = Blues,
          k_row = 5, # 5 clusters 
          margins = c(NA,200,60,NA), # margin to change the top and bottom margins
          fontsize_row = 4, # size betweeen rows 
          fontsize_col = 5, # size between columns 
          main="World Happiness Score and Variables by Country, 2018 \nDataTransformation using Normalise Method",
          xlab = "World Happiness Indicators",
          ylab = "World Countries"
          )
```
