## Buidling Parrallel Plot 
- Using two libraries
- Adaption from [D3 JS Ploting Library](https://d3js.org)
- you can rearrange the columns
- There are two different functions to build the parrallel coordinate
- `parallelplot` R and also `ggparacoord`


```{r}
packages = c('GGally', 'plotly', 'parcoords', 'parallelPlot', 'tidyverse')

for (p in packages){
  if(!require(p, character.only = T)){
    install.packages(p)
  }
  library(p,character.only = T)
}
```

```{r}
wh <- read_csv("data/WHData-2018.csv")
```
- Column GDP to perception of corruption
- this chart however, is not good, there is no application of any aesthetic elements
```{r}
ggparcoord(data = wh, 
           columns = c(7:12))
```
In this example we will apply scale, group column and standardization

**standardization**
- we can use the robust (skewed use robust) vs uniminmax (use for wide data range) vs std (z score used for normal distirbution)
- we can also use a globalminmax (all of the variables are considered)

**order**
- order the parrallel coordination based on some statistics 
- Example, we can perform anova and it will arrange the columns by the statistics on each feature

**groupcolumn**
- Group column by which column using the column number based on the specific data set
- 2 in this case is region 
- thus, we can see the variation of the region statistics based on the groups we specify

For most of these data columns, we need to consider the different scaling methods before plotting the graph
 

```{r}
ggparcoord(data = wh, 
           columns = c(7:12), 
           groupColumn = 2,
           scale = "uniminmax", # can try global minmax and so on
           alphaLines = 0.2, # opacity of the lines
           boxplot = TRUE,  # display the distribution of the parallel plots
           title = "Parallel Coord. Plot of World Happines Attributes")
```

```{r}
ggparcoord(data = wh, 
           columns = c(7:12), 
           groupColumn = 2,
           scale = "uniminmax", 
           boxplot = TRUE, 
           title = "Parallel Coord. Plot of World Happines Attributes") +
  facet_wrap(~ Region) # we can add a facet wrap and then we can have a facet grid of the regions
```

```{r}
parcoords(wh[,7:12])
```

```{r}
parcoords(
 wh[,7:12],
 rownames = FALSE,
 reorderable = T,
 brushMode = '1D-axes',
 width = 700,
 height = 400)
```

```{r}
parcoords(
 wh[,7:12],
 rownames = FALSE,
 alpha = 0.3,
 alphaOnBrushed = 0.2,
 reorderable = T,
 brushMode = '1D-axes',
 width = 700,
 height = 400)
```

```{r}
wh <- wh %>%
  select("Happiness score", c(7:12))
parallelPlot(wh)
```

```{r}
parallelPlot(wh,
             rotateTitle = TRUE)
```

```{r}
parallelPlot(wh,
             continuousCS = "YlOrRd",
             rotateTitle = TRUE)
```

```{r}
histoVisibility <- rep(TRUE, ncol(wh))
parallelPlot(wh,
             rotateTitle = TRUE,
             histoVisibility = histoVisibility)
```
- No tool-tips for hovering 


- inclusion of interactivity
- 

```{r}

```
