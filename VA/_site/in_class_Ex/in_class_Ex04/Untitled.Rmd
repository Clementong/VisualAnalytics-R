`gghistostats()` : statistical best pratice statisical reporting of the charts 

- extension of ggplot 
https://indrajeetpatil.github.io/ggstatsplot/
- regression output we use sth else
- work with it as a wrapper

- type : can just use the first letter except for non-parametric which uses np 
- test > statistics type
- frequentist approach : critical value 
- bayes factor follows the B10 (converted back to the natural log)

```{r}
set.seed(1234)
gghistostats(
  data = exam,
  type="p",
  x = ENGLISH,
  test.value = 60, # mean value vs actual mean value
  xlab = "English scores"
)
```

## ggbetweenstats() - violin boxplot

###Two - Sample mean comparison test 
-  Changing the method type then we can see the different report 
- Changing the x and y will result in a vertical violin plot : vertical is ideal for better comparison
- Anova (here!)
- **you need to understand what the test is used and what is the central tendency measure displayed**

```{r}
ggbetweenstats(
  data = exam,
  x = GENDER, 
  y = MATHS,
  type = "np",
  messages = FALSE
)
```

## Anova using `betweenstats()`

- one way anova test 

`pairwise.display`
ns" → only non-significant
"s" → only significant
"all" → everything

```{r}
library(PMCMRplus)
ggbetweenstats(
  data = exam,
  x = RACE, 
  y = ENGLISH,
  type = "p",
  mean.ci = TRUE, 
  pairwise.comparisons = TRUE, 
  pairwise.display = "s",
  p.adjust.method = "fdr",
  messages = FALSE
)

```

 Chonese and the Malay pair is found to be significant
 
 ## ggscatterstats 
 
 - Marginal true vs false

```{r}
ggscatterstats(
  data = exam,
  x = MATHS,
  y = ENGLISH,
  marginal = FALSE,
  )
```

```{r}
ggscatterstats(
  data = exam,
  x = MATHS,
  y = ENGLISH,
  marginal = TRUE,
  )
```

if you want to change the side distribution, you need to use `ggside()` rather than using this library

```{r}
exam1 <- exam %>% 
  mutate(MATHS_bins = 
           cut(MATHS, 
               breaks = c(0,60,75,85,100))
)

ggbarstats(exam1, 
           x = MATHS_bins, 
           y = GENDER)


```


```{r}

```
