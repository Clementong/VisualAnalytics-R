Distill is a publication format for scientific and technical writing, native to the web.

# Packages
 - these packages are part of the family called easystats

```{r}
packages = c('readxl', 'report', 'performance', 
             'parameters', 'see')
for(p in packages){
  if(!require(p, character.only = T)){
    install.packages(p)
  }
  library(p, character.only = T)
}

```



```{r}
car_resale <- read_xls("data/ToyotaCorolla.xls", 
                       "data")

```


```{r}
model <- lm(Price ~ Age_08_04 + Mfg_Year + KM + 
              Weight + Guarantee_Period, data = car_resale)
model
```
Once the model is created :

- Check for multi-colinearity (VIF)
   + greater than 5 multicolinearity present 


```{r}
check_collinearity(model)

# loose coupling 
check_c <- check_collinearity(model)
plot(check_c) # plot this tibble form

```
1. Which has low VIF which have high? 

We can also print the table and realise tht it takes all the indepdent variable to form the VIF and SE scores 

```{r}
library(kableExtra)
kable(head(check_c))
# first column all independent variables
```

```{r}
# understanding the data structure and plot it
# if perfectly overlap , reflect null hypothesis 
check_n <- check_normality(model)
plot(check_n)
```

```{r}
# all assumption test are the same
check_h <- check_heteroscedasticity(model)
plot(check_h)
```

**go back look at the output and try**


```{r}
check_model(model)
```

```{r}
# Coefficient weights
plot(parameters(model))
```

```{r}
# this is better with the coeff + pvalue for the regression
ggcoefstats(model, 
            output = "plot")

# anyting on the left is negative anything is positive is on the right  

# this is not as good as the previous example because the colors one is rainbow but the other plot positive is blue and red is negative
```


#Visualising uncertainty

```{r}
exam %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = RACE, y = MATHS)) +
  stat_eye() +
  ggtitle("stat_eye()")
```
